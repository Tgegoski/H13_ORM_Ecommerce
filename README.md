# 13 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End

E-commerce, or Internet retail, is a very fast growing industry, especially during this pandemic.  Businesses need to have a e-commerce site so creating the back end and front end for an e-commerce website is an important skill.

This project requires refactoring of starter code using Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with MYSQL.This project also uses dotenv to store sensitive data and Insomnia Core for testing API GET, POST, PUT and DELETE requests.

## User Story

AS A Manger of an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies.


## Acceptance Criteria

This application using Express.js API allows the user to add a database name, MYSQL password to an environment variable file. The user can then connect to a database using Sequelize.  When they enter schema and seed commands then a development database is created and is seeded with data.  When the user enters the command to invoke the application then the server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MYSQL database.  When the user opens the API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON. When the user tests API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia then they are able to successfully create, update and delete data in their database.
